          <h1>About Greg</h1>
          <p>Greg was born on April 16, 1990. He was a son, a brother, a friend, a student, an athlete, but most of all he was a young man who truly knew how to live. On December 20, 2008 Greg died from a severe brain injury sustained in a skateboarding accident five days prior. The indisputable cause of the severity of Gregâ€™s injury was his failure to wear a helmet. By his own choosing, Greg was a blood, organ and tissue donor. Transplants of his heart, lungs, liver and kidneys have already helped saved the lives of four individuals, and one person has been given the gift of sight from his eye donation. Medical research and potentially hundreds of lives will also benefit from his tissue, nerve, bone and cell donations.</p>
